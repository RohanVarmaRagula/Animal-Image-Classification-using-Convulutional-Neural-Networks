# Animal-Image-Classification-using-Convulutional-Neural-Networks
This project develops a deep learning model that recognizes image of an animal using Convulutional Neural Nets and Transfer Learning.
## üìÅ Dataset
The models developed are trained on [Animal-10](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alessiocorrado99/animals10) dataset from Kaggle. It contains about 28K medium quality animal images belonging to 10 categories: dog, cat, horse, spyder, butterfly, chicken, sheep, cow, squirrel, elephant.
## üîë Key Features
1. The best CNN model was able to achieve an accuracy of approximately 60% and still have scope for improvement, but need to train longer.
2. Upon integrating with pre-trained weights of *Xception* model,an outstanding accuracy of 96.72% is achieved.
3. Visualized model performance using Confusion matrix and accuracy/loss curves to identify areas of improvement.
 4. Can be used to identify species of animals without human intervention and aids in monitoring biodiversity.
